light travels in straight lines
light rays do not collide with each other if they cross
light rays travel from the light sources to the eye

reciprocity 可逆性

and if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

Whitted-Style Ray Tracing

假设:

eye is a point

定义:

- eye ray
- shadow rays

- primary ray
- secondary rays

Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) 轴对齐包围盒

- The ray enters the box only when it enters all pairs of slabs
- The ray exits the box as long as it exits any pair of slabs


Objects vs. Spatial Partition
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) vs. KD-Tree

  Geometry
Radiometry

- radiant energy (s)
- radiant flux (vol)
- intensity
- irradiance

- radiance def.1: irradiance per solid angle
- radiance def.2: intensity per projected unit area

- BRDF: Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function
- sr: solid radius

# Scent of a woman (1992)

No mistakes in the Tango, not like life. It's simple, that's what makes the Tango so great. If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just Tango on.

# Rudy (1993)

Having dreams is what makes life tolerable

# The Shawshank Redemption (1994)

Get busy living or get busy dying

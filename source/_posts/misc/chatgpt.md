# Linux

## [`mmu_notifier`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc6/source/include/linux/mmu_notifier.h#L237) vs. [`mmu_interval_notifier`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc6/source/include/linux/mmu_notifier.h#L257) 

M: please shed light on the distinction mmu_notifier from mmu_interval_notifier in the linux kernel

C: In the Linux kernel, both MMU notifier and MMU interval notifier are used to track changes in page tables and memory mappings. However, there are some differences between the two:

MMU notifier is used to track changes to page tables and memory mappings, and it is designed to be a general-purpose notifier. It is used by various subsystems in the kernel, such as memory management, file systems, and device drivers.

MMU interval notifier, on the other hand, is used specifically to track changes to a range of memory pages. It is used by subsystems that need to be notified of changes to a particular range of memory pages, such as virtualization subsystems.

In summary, MMU notifier is a more general-purpose notifier used to track changes to page tables and memory mappings, while MMU interval notifier is used specifically to track changes to a range of memory pages.

## [`ww_mutex`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc6/source/include/linux/ww_mutex.h#L47)

M: Why is the wound/wait mutex capable of deadlock avoidance in the linux kernel?

C: In the Linux kernel, the wound/wait mutex is a synchronization mechanism used to protect shared data structures from concurrent access by multiple threads. It is called wound/wait mutex because a thread that tries to acquire the mutex is wounded (i.e., put to sleep) and waits until it can acquire the mutex.

The wound/wait mutex is capable of deadlock avoidance because it uses a priority inheritance protocol to prevent priority inversions, which can cause deadlocks. In a priority inversion scenario, a high-priority thread is blocked by a lower-priority thread that holds a resource it needs, which can lead to a deadlock. The priority inheritance protocol ensures that the priority of the thread holding the mutex is temporarily boosted to the same priority as the highest-priority thread waiting for the mutex, preventing priority inversions and potential deadlocks.

In summary, the wound/wait mutex is capable of deadlock avoidance because it uses a priority inheritance protocol to prevent priority inversions and potential deadlocks.

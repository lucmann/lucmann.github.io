The story begins with debugging an OpenGL demo on the WSL with the Mesa libraries compiled by myself. Every time the executable will crash when it stops at the breakpoint and steps into the function. The gdb outputs as follows:
``` bash
Thread 1 "osdemo" hit Breakpoint 1, OSMesaMakeCurrent (osmesa=0x8056bf0, buffer=0x7ffff85f0010, type=5121, width=400, height=400)

I did not consider this crash as a WSL bug until I found this [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3618) on the github. Then I realized that I had to update my WSL that is updated as the Windows is updated. The easy way to get the latest Windows build version is to register the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/zh-cn/) that only requires

- Windows 10
- Microsoft Account

Once you register successfully, you can check the Windows Updates for the latest Windows build.
